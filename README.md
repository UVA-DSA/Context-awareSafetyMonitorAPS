# ContextSafetyMonitorAPS
This is the repository for evaluation of different Context-aware Safety Monitors for Artificial Pancreas Systems (APS).
It integrates  two  Closed-loop  Simulation  Platforms  (GlucosymSimulator with OpenAps Controller and UVA-Padova T1DS2013 Simulator with Basal-Bolus Controller) with a Software Fault Injeciton Engine.
