# ContextSafetyMonitorAPS
This is the repository for evaluation of different Context-aware Safety Monitors for Artificial Pancreas Systems (APS).
It integrates  two  Closed-loop  Simulation  Platforms  (GlucosymSimulator with OpenAps Controller and UVA-Padova T1DS2013 Simulator with Basal-Bolus Controller) with a Software Fault Injeciton Engine.

**HOW To CITE:** 
X. Zhou, B. Ahmed, J. H. Ayloret al., “Data-driven Design of Context-aware Monitors for Hazard Prediction in Artificial Pancreas Systemss,” in the 51st IEEE/IFIP International Conference on Dependable Systems and Networks (DSN 2021), 2021. [Online Available](https://arxiv.org/abs/2104.02545)
